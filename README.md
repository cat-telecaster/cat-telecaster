Welcome to my GitHub!
I mostly share projects I have done either to learn or because I wanted to try something new.

Stuff I'll be trying soon™:
- three.js (probably when i decide to make my portfolio site???)
- something to do with image processing (in progress - image filter app with PIL and cv2)

☕&🍵
